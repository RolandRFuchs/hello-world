# hello-world
This is me doing a small description for my big ass hello world project...

I am Roland, i have a couple of friends and they all call me something different, some call me Ro, some called me Ro-Ro, others call me Roly, and more call me Roman. Apparently im pretty strong at Rock Climbing, but i beg to differ... theres alot left to do and i wont stop training unless i get bored.
